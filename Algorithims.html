        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            The word "algorithm" has a fascinating historical journey that spans continents and 
            centuries. It derives from the name of the celebrated Persian mathematician and 
            astronomer <span class="key-point">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</span> (c. 780–850 CE), 
            who lived during the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, a major center of learning during 
            the Islamic Golden Age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Al-Khwarizmi made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, particularly in the 
            development of algebra. His seminal treatise, <span class="arabic-text">"Al-Kitab 
            al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala"</span> (The Compendious Book on Calculation 
            by Completion and Balancing), introduced systematic methods for solving linear and 
            quadratic equations. This work not only established algebra as an independent discipline 
            but also introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to the Islamic world and later to Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Latinized version of his name, <strong>"Algoritmi"</strong>, became associated with 
            arithmetic and mathematical procedures in medieval Europe. When his works were translated 
            into Latin during the 12th century, the term "algorism" emerged to describe the systematic 
            methods of calculation using the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. Over the following centuries, 
            the term gradually expanded in meaning to encompass any well-defined set of rules for 
            solving problems or accomplishing tasks, regardless of whether the task involved mathematics.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                <strong>Historical Timeline:</strong> The term evolved from a scholar's name in the 
                9th century, to "algorism" for arithmetic methods in medieval Europe, to the modern 
                "algorithm" encompassing all computational procedures in the 20th century with the 
                rise of computer science.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <p>
                <strong>Algorithm (noun):</strong> A finite sequence of well-defined, step-by-step 
                instructions for solving a specific problem, performing a computation, or accomplishing 
                a particular task. In computer science and mathematics, an algorithm serves as a precise 
                blueprint that guides computational processes from simple arithmetic calculations to 
                complex operations in artificial intelligence systems.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            For a procedure to qualify as an algorithm, it must satisfy several essential criteria. 
            First, it must be <span class="key-point">precise</span>—each instruction must be 
            unambiguous and clearly specified, leaving no room for interpretation. Second, it must 
            be <span class="key-point">finite</span>—it must eventually terminate after completing 
            a specific number of steps. Third, it must be <span class="key-point">effective</span>— 
            each step must be simple enough to be performed exactly, either by a human or by a computer. 
            Finally, an algorithm must produce a <span class="key-point">correct output</span> for 
            any valid input, guaranteeing the desired result when executed properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, including natural language, flowcharts, 
            programming code, and formal mathematical notation. They form the foundation of all 
            software applications, from simple calculators to sophisticated machine learning systems 
            that power modern technology.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Example Sentences</h2>
        
        <div class="example-section">
            <h3>Denotative Meaning</h3>
            <div class="example-box denotative-example">
                <span class="example-label">Denotative Example</span>
                <p class="sentence">
                    "The computer science students learned how to implement the <strong>quicksort 
                    algorithm</strong>, which efficiently arranges elements in ascending order by 
                    recursively partitioning the list around a pivot element."
                </p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <strong>Analysis:</strong> In this sentence, "algorithm" is used in its literal, 
                    technical sense to describe a specific computational procedure for organizing data. 
                    The context includes precise technical details (quicksort, recursively partitioning, 
                    pivot element) that demonstrate the objective, factual meaning of the term without 
                    any emotional overtones or subjective associations.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Connotative Meaning</h3>
            <div class="example-box connotative-example">
                <span class="example-label">Connotative Example</span>
                <p class="sentence">
                    "Critics argue that social media <strong>algorithms</strong> have too much power 
                    over what information people consume, creating echo chambers that reinforce existing 
                    beliefs and potentially manipulate public opinion."
                </p>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <strong>Analysis:</strong> In this sentence, "algorithms" carries significant 
                    connotative meaning beyond its technical definition. The words "too much power," 
                    "echo chambers," and "manipulate public opinion" reveal the negative associations 
                    algorithms can carry in contemporary discourse—suggesting concerns about loss of 
                    autonomy, corporate control over information, and threats to democratic discourse.

                Understanding the etymology and dual meanings of "algorithms"—both denotative and 
                connotative—is essential for informed discussions about the role of technology in 
                modern society. While algorithms are fundamentally technical concepts, their social 
                and ethical implications depend heavily on how they are designed, deployed, and governed.
